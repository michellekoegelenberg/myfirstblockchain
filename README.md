# Building a Blockchain in Go

This repo is based on a couple of online resources, including the YouTube Tutorial Series "Building a blockchain in Golang" by Tensor programming.

Branches represent chapters.

Chapter 3 code is different to Tensor's due to BadgerDB API updates (Tensor uses v1 and I am using v3). At this point (chapter 4) I started deviating a bit from Tensor's tutorial.
